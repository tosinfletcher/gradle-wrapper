# gradle-wrapper

This is a collection of scripts that will install Gradle all by itself. As long as Java 7 or later
has already been installed.

1. clone the Git repository into your home directory.
2. Use the command: "cp -r gradle-wrapper/* <<directory path you would likt to copy the scrpits into>>" 
   to copy all the scripts from gradle-wrapper directory into the directory you would 
   like to create a Gradle Build and Initialize the Gradle build from.

   Note: Ignore the double quotes from the command.

This will make it much easier to instll Gradle and run builds.
